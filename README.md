# BreakingNews

An application that takes in a section from the New York Times and fetches the top ten most recently published stories from that section in New York Times. This project was created as the final project for my Interactive Systems Design and Technology class.

## Languages used

## Tools used
Jinja2, The New York Times Top Stories API

### How do I get the key for the New York Times Top Stories API?
First, you'll have to go to this link: https://developer.nytimes.com/. Then, click on "Request an API Key". It should redirect you to this link: https://developer.nytimes.com/signup/. On this page, they'll ask you for your name, email, website (I filled this field out with my website to my portfolio link), and what API you want to use (The New York Times has 11 APIs!)

You'll have to specify that you want the Top Stories API when they ask you what API key you want. But, if you already have an API key from any of the New York Times, the key you already have should work. If not, request the Top Stories API specifically.
